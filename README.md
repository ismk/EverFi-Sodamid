EverFi Challenge creating a soda pyramid







Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional soda can pyramid you can. And then probably drink those sodas, because let's pretend it's Friday too.

A soda can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1 can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25...

Complete the sodamid function to return the number of complete levels of a soda can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of:

1) your referral bonus, and

2) the price of a soda can
